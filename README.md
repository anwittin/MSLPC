Simple Student Loan Tracking App
This is my attempt to build my excel spreadsheet into a webapp so that it is
portable and accessable. I would like to make this open to anyone who is working
on paying off student loans.

If you stumble upon this app and want to contribute feel free, I am very new to
Django and just getting back into Python.

## Project Discription
I have a excel spreadsheet that I have used for several years to track my student
loan payments and progress. I want to convert this to a Django/Python project so
it is accessable on the web as well as to others whom may find it useful.

## Initial Buildout

My initial though on this app is to break it out in to small app pieces. Here are my breakouts:

### Payment Information
A simple area that will describe what your monthly payment looks like and how much you should 
budget. Also a place to enter any extra payments you may want to enter.

### Payment Progress & Goals
A widget that shows what you payment goals look like and your progress towards those goals.
